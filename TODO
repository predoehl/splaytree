DONE:

Program driver1 if tweaked can manifest another bug -- instead of resetting
the tree to the nicely balanced test tree, and searching each key,
we can get a segfault if we search the same set of keys, starting from the
initial complete tree, but NOT resetting each time.  That should still work
ok of course -- no excuse for a segfault.
TODO: find it, fix it.
Resolution: tweak was retained as new program driver3, and the bug was trivial.

DONE:

Program driver1 does not generate correct results -- it provokes a bug
to manifest within splay.c, which is GOOD.  Example: ./driver1 1
